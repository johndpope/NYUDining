# Current Release Notes
Version 1.4.1 contains a quick fix for an issue that would rarely cause a crash. It also introduces (beta) support for viewing information offline!

# End of Support For Old Versions
NYUDining's previous database host, Parse, is shutting down in the near future. As a result, all version prior to 1.3.0 are no longer supported and will not receive the latest hours. All up to date versions should still receive updates to the dining hall schedule.
