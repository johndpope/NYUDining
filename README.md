# Current Release Notes
Version 1.4.0 is completely rewritten, making the app much faster and more efficient!

# A Note about Parse
Parse, the service that hosts and provides the data for the NYUDining app, recently announced that they are beginning to wind down its services, taking the entire database offline early next year. In anticipation of this, I have already completed the migration of the app data from Parse to Firebase. This change is effective as of the latest version. To receive the most up to date information in your app, please update ASAP
# End of Support For Old Versions
With Parse shutting down, versions prior to 1.3.0 will cease to function at any given moment. As a result, all users must update to the latest version ASAP for uninturrupted access to information.
